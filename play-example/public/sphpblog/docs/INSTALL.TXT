Simple PHP Blog:
----------------

Installation
------------
1) Download and unzip the .zip file.
2) FTP files to your web server.
3) Visit the index.php page.
4) Follow on screen instructions.

Trouble Shooting
----------------
Simple PHP Blog stores all of your information in three
separate folders. These folders are dynamically created:

config/
content/
images/

The installation process will attempt to create these
folders. However, if write permissions are disabled,
you will have to manually create these folders and set
the write permissions yourself.

After creating the folders, visit the index.php page
again. It will walk you through the rest of the process.

More Trouble Shooting
---------------------
If you are still having trouble saving your username and
password, it is most likely due to a SAFE MODE issue.

By default, PHP is set to run in SAFE MODE.

PHP does a UID (User ID) compare check when opening files.
If the "sb_functions.php" file has a different UID then the
"config" directory, then it will not be able to write any
files to it...

The solution is to change the UIDs of all the files and
directories so that they are all the same. This will enable
the PHP files to create files and directories.

This can be accompilshed with the CHOWN command, if you
has access to the server. Otherwise, you will need to
contact your service provider, and tell them to change
the UID of the directory.
